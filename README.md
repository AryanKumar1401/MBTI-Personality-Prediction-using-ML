# MBTI Personality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personalities based on textual data using machine learning techniques. The MBTI is a popular psychometric tool used to understand human personality preferences and behavior patterns.

## Project Overview

The project involves:
- Collecting a dataset of texts (e.g., social media posts, forum discussions) labeled with MBTI types.
- Preprocessing the text data to extract relevant features.
- Training machine learning models to predict MBTI types based on these features.
- Evaluating the models based on accuracy and other relevant metrics.
- Building a web application or API for predicting MBTI types using the trained models.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing consists of:
- Textual data (e.g., posts, comments) labeled with MBTI types.
- Each instance is associated with a specific MBTI type (e.g., "INTJ", "ENFP").

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Explore the Jupyter notebook for detailed steps on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
